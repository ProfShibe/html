<h2>Here's my top 3 favorite movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>My favorite movie probably ever. Very emotional at the end and is space themed.</p>

<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>I drive. I literally starred in it. Ryan Gosling is literally me.</p>

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>The only anime I've really watched and it's fire. Could never remember the name 
but I'll rewatch again for the billionth time.</p>
